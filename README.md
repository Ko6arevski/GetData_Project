The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The raw data for this project can be downloaded form [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
  
#### In this repository you will find:
1. README.md -- the file that you currently read
2. run_analysis.R -- the script used to get from raw to tidy data
3. Tidy_data.txt -- the final product of the script
4. CodeBook.md -- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
  
#### Reproducing the tidy data
After the compressed raw data have been downloaded, make sure to unzip it in your working directory and rename the folder to "Raw_data".  
After this, running the code in R should produce the same data as observed in the "Tidy_data.txt".
